## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML CSS JS Node Express Nodemailer Dotenv

Built out the structure and presentation of the product for the frontend then worked on the backend for the functionality of creating a database of emails directly to the owners email.

## Optimizations

Custom fonts would be a plus, using a custom image from the owners bar and cocktails to be implemented when the bar business is up and running. Functionality of the email database is working on local machines and local hosts but not on production. Would also change the clunky alert message to an onclick event that would notify the customer that the email has been sent succesfully.

## Lessons Learned:

Dove deep into the nodemailer library. Learned of other similar libraries that would facilitate the end goals I wanted to execute. More experience with backend achieved.
